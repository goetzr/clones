- The [Docker Hub API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/) is fundamentally different from the [Docker Hub Registry API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry/latest/):
	- The functionality of the two APIs is largely disjoint
	- You use the Docker Hub Registry API for low-level interaction with image layers and manifests (push, pull, delete image tags)
	- You use the Docker Hub API for high-level management of the platform metadata (create repo, add team member, trigger auto-build)
- The Docker Hub Registry API docs provide an excellent [example](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry/latest/#tag/pull) detailing how to pull an image from the registry
- [Registry Authentication Docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry/auth/)
- [OCI Distribution Specification](https://specs.opencontainers.org/distribution-spec/)
- [OCI Distribution Specification Reference Implementation](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/api/) that was used by Docker
