- [OCI image specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md)
- [Docker Hub API documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/)
- API server: https://registry.hub.docker.com
- Use the [List repository tags](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/#tag/repositories/operation/ListRepositoryTags) endpoint to list the first 10 tags in the nginx repository (image): 
    ```bash
    curl -s --http1.1 \
        "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/library/repositories/nginx/tags?page=1&page_size=10" \
        | jq '.["results"] | .[] | .name'
    ```
	- `-s` puts curl into silent mode, causing it not to show its progress meter or error messages.
	- `--http1.1` makes curl use HTTP 1.1. The Docker Hub API was designed for HTTP 1.1.
	- Official Docker images are located in the `library` namespace.
	- The image name is the repository.
	- `jq` filters the JSON response returned from curl:
		- .\["results"\] selects the "results" object
		- | .\[\] passes the "results" object output from the previous filter as input to the .\[\] filter, which iterates through all items in the array
		- | .name passes each item in the array output from the previous filter as input to the .name filter, which selects the "name" field in each entry
		- The entire filter pipeline (the `jq` program) is surrounded by single quotes to prevent interpretation by the shell
