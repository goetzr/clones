# Image
- An image consists of several different components:
	- Image manifest
	- Image index (optional)
	- A set of filesystem layers
	- A configuration
- The image components are arranged in a Merkle tree
- References between components in the graph are expressed through Content Descriptors
- Can be discovered by name, downloaded, verified by hash, trusted through a signature, and unpacked into an OCI runtime bundle
- 
## Image Manifest
- Contains metadata about the contents and dependencies of the image
	- Includes content-addressable identity of one or more fileystem layer changset archives that will be unpacked to make up the final runnable filesystem
## Image Configuration
- Includes information such as application arguments, environments, etc.
## Image Index
- Higher level manifest that points to a list of manifests and descriptors
	- Typically these manifests may provide different implementations of the image, possibly varying by platform or other attributes
- The image index is returned as the response body when using the [List repository tags](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/#tag/repositories/operation/ListRepositoryTags) endpoint on Docker Hub
- Media type = application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json
## Content Descriptors
- Describes the disposition of the targeted content
- Includes:
	- The type of the content
	- A content identifier (digest)
	- The byte size of the raw content
### Digest
- Acts as a content identifier, enabling content addressability
- Uniquely identifies content using collision-resistant hash
#### Verification
- Verify size first
- If size matches, verify hash
